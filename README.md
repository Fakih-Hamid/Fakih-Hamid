• Experimental system evaluation  
• Security assessment and analysis  
• Application development

## Current Work
I am a Master’s student and Research Assistant at the Cyber-Resilience Lab, NAIST, working on privacy-preserving and open-source cybersecurity education frameworks designed for real-world use. My research explores how security awareness and digital resilience can be strengthened through user-centric design, without relying on cloud-heavy or invasive data collection.

## Selected Projects
- **Project Aegis**  
  Autonomous fuzzing environment with guided coverage and policy-based sandboxing.
- **Security Tool (C++)**  
  Windows-focused system integrity and anti-cheat demonstrator using modern C++.
- **Industrial Security Modeling**  
  Research-oriented tool for modeling ICS/OT dependencies and cybersecurity impact analysis.
